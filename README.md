⚠️ **Important Note**  
The demo above is **just an example** running with **my own Google reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise site key and API key** for my domain.  
These keys are shown **only for demonstration purposes** in the video and are not usable outside my server.  

💡 I can create the same type of **token generator** for **any website** — all you need to provide is:  
1. Your **reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise site key**  
2. Your **secret API key** from your Google Cloud project  

This ensures the tool works with **your domain(s)** securely and in compliance with Google’s terms.
